# 🌌 Tribes.app — The Privacy-First Social Hub

Welcome to **Tribes.app**, a modern, beautiful, and open-source social communication platform built with a deep commitment to **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** and a state-of-the-art **Concentric Rings UX** design. 

Unlike traditional platforms that sell your interactions, Tribes isolates your digital life into secure, context-aware circles—giving you absolute control over who sees what, with cryptographically enforced guarantees.

## 🎨 Cryptographic UX Architecture

Tribes is built around a **Post-First, Scope-After** model utilizing **Concentric Rings** to define the privacy boundaries of every post:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A((Journal)) --> B((Inner Circle))
    B --> C((My People))
    C --> D((My Tribes))
    D --> E((Mood Streams))
    style A fill:#6366f1,stroke:#4f46e5,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#3b82f6,stroke:#2563eb,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style C fill:#06b6d4,stroke:#0891b2,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style D fill:#10b981,stroke:#059669,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style E fill:#f59e0b,stroke:#d97706,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

1. **Journal (Solo)**: Private by default. Your personal encrypted space. Posts are promotional-only (e.g. pinned to your profile wall).
2. **Inner Circle (Pairwise/Close)**: The closest circle of bonds. Uses custom cryptographic rings.
3. **My People (Broad Friends)**: Your general social circle.
4. **My Tribes (Group-Based)**: Shared spaces centered around themes, organizations, or private groups.
5. **Mood Streams (Discovery)**: Promotion-only streams curated and promoted by tribe founders to public/mood discovery streams.

## 🛡️ End-to-End Encryption Models

To enforce this architecture, Tribes integrates three specialized E2EE models:

*   **Journal Model (Personal Key)**: Content is encrypted using a client-derived AES key unique to the user, backed up securely via an encrypted PRF Key Vault (utilizing passkey credentials).
*   **Bond Rings (Pairwise Sender Keys)**: Dynamic, pairwise-derived sender key chains secure direct posts and messages in concentric rings. If a bond is revoked, keys rotate automatically.
*   **Private Tribes (Group Symmetric Key)**: Tribe posts are encrypted utilizing a shared group key. Solo-founder private tribes use a public status-safe encryption guard to prevent leakage before other members join.

## 🌲 Git Branching & Lifecycle Model

To ensure high-quality software delivery and a secure codebase, Tribes implements a strict branching model:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial stable"
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    commit id: "Feature A work"
    commit id: "Feature A ready"
    checkout main
    merge dev id: "Release 1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"
    checkout dev
    branch feature/e2ee-rotation
    checkout feature/e2ee-rotation
    commit id: "Key rotation logic"
    checkout dev
    merge feature/e2ee-rotation id: "Merged to Dev"
```

### Branches

*   **`main` (Production & Stable)**:
    *   Represents the current production-deployed release.
    *   **Protected Branch**: Push access is locked. Code enters `main` only via pull requests from `dev`.
    *   **Automated Release**: Merges to `main` trigger the zero-downtime blue/green deployment workflow to the production servers.
*   **`dev` (Active Integration)**:
    *   The primary integration environment for active contributors.
    *   All pull requests for new features, bug fixes, and security patches target `dev`.
    *   Once a cycle is fully validated on local/UAT environments, `dev` is merged into `main`.
*   **`feature/*` / `bugfix/*`**:
    *   Isolated branches created by developers for single features or fixes.
    *   Gated by continuous integration testing before merging into `dev`.

## 🚀 Local Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js**: v20 or v22 (LTS)
*   **Package Manager**: `npm`

### 1. Setup Environment
Clone the repository and copy the environment variables file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Fill in the database, encryption vaults, and verification keys in `.env.local`.

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Apply Schema Migrations
Generate and run local SQLite migrations:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. Seed the Database
Populate local tables with test fixtures:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 5. Launch the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the application.

## 🧪 Testing Suites

Before submitting any Pull Request, ensure that all compilation and test checks pass.

*   **Typecheck validation**:
    ```bash
    npm run typecheck
    ```
*   **Unit & Integration Tests** (Vitest):
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
*   **End-to-End Tests** (Playwright):
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```

## 🚢 Production Deployment

Tribes features a **zero-downtime, blue/green deployment strategy** configured on Hetzner VPS instances under a Caddy reverse proxy:

*   **Image Management**: The pipeline preserves the previous docker image as `tribes-app:rollback` before rebuilding.
*   **Database Security**: Versioned migrations are validated and applied via a temporary builder container using `drizzle-kit migrate`. If a migration fails, the deploy aborts instantly.
*   **Swap Strategy**: The workflow spins up the inactive container color (blue or green), verifies its health endpoint, reloads the Caddy reverse proxy config, and safely stops the older container color with **0ms downtime** to clients.

This is executed automatically upon merging code into `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
