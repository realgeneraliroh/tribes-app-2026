/**
 * Defines the different user roles within the Tribes.app system, aligned with the business model tiers.
 *
 * - `Admin`: Site administrators with platform-wide powers. This role is separate from user-facing tiers.
 * - `Creator`: Corresponds to **Tier 2 (Individual Member)** and **Tier 3 (Organizational Member)**.
 *   These users can create and manage tribes, organize events, and access creator tools.
 * - `Human`: Corresponds to **Tier 1 (Free User)**. These users can join tribes and participate,
 *   but cannot create their own tribes or events.
 * - `Speaker`: (Moderator) A role *within* a tribe, not a platform-wide tier. Appointed by tribe Creators
 *   to help manage a specific community.
 * - `Bot`: API-driven interfaces with specific rulesets, distinct from human users.
